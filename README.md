# Restart_Gaussian

* Restart.py is a program that is mainly developed to calculate Gaussian files automatically.

* what will happen if there is a power failure in the middle of the calculations? they will stop! when you start the calculations in the same path/directory, Restart.py will help you start them where they were interrupted. it will create a "Restart" file for the last "xyz.com" file which was interrupted by the power failure.
