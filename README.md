# Restart_Gaussian

* Restart.py is a program that is mainly developed to calculate Gaussian out files automatically.

* what will happen if there is a power failure? the calculations will stop! when you start the calculations in the same path/directory, then it will start where it was interrupted. it will create a "Restart" file for the last "xyz.com" file which was interrupted by the power failure.
