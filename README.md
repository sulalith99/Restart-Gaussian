# Restart

* Restart.py is a program that is mainly developed to calculate Gaussian files automatically.

* what will happen if there is a power failure in the middle of the calculations? they will stop! when you start the calculations in the same path/directory, Restart.py will help you restart them where they were interrupted. it will create "Restart" files for the last "xyz.com" files which were interrupted by the power failure.
